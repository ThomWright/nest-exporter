# Redirects

From the Nest Api docs:

> It is also a best practice to store the redirected location on a per user basis. In other words, after a user signs in and a redirect is received, store the firebase-apiserver03-tah01-iad01.dapi.production.nest.com:9553/ location and make all subsequent requests directly to this URI.
